     * Calls a GetConnector to get one batch of a large data set.
     *
     * Getting data in batches can be useful to prevent timeouts / work with the
     * required 'take' parameter to AFAS GetConnector calls. For this to work,
     * we have to be able to order the data set by an immutable field*, so a
     * unique, immutable field should be added to the data set and its fieldname
     * must be specified in the 'sortable_id_field' argument. Note that we never
     * use the 'skip' parameter for fetching subsequent batches: 'skip' is fine
     * for 'human paging' but poses a risk of data loss if records are deleted
     * while we're getting data.
     * * The order-by field must be immutable but not necessarily unique; there
     *   is an argument to specify non-uniqueness. In this case, this method
     *   will check for duplicate records in subsequent fetched batches and weed
     *   out duplicates. This is however non-ideal, possibly slower (because of
     *   double-fetched records) and introduces unsupported edge cases where
     *   this method will simply throw an exception.
     * * Unlike uniqueness, immutability is just blindly assumed. 'mutable'
     *   fields will risk data loss (just like 'skip paging') if their values
     *   are changed while fetching data. If there really is no immutable field
     *   in the connector, the next best thing is a field that always increments
     *   so at least you don't lost records in your data set, only duplications.
     *   (One example of this is a 'last updated' field. The chance of
     *   duplicates for this is higher than you might think, though, because we
     *   need to work around AFAS filter bugs. See id_field_type='date' code.)
     *
     * Batched fetching does not work with 'OR type' filters, only with 'AND'.
     *
     * @param array $args
     *   Arguments used to create / process the getData() calls. These must stay
     *   the same over subsequent calls made to fetch a full data set.
     *   - connection (\PracticalAfas\Connetion; required):
     *     The connection object to use. (If we feel the need, we might remove
     *     the required-ness of this value and make this a non-static method
     *     later.)
     *   - connector (string; required):
     *     The connector name.
     *   - id_field (string; required):
     *     The (recommended) unique, (strongly recommended) immutable field that
     *     will be used for ordering. Can be preceded by '-' to force descending
     *     ordering (though the use for this is unclear).
     *   - id_field_type (string):
     *     Necessary when the value in the ID field is not suitable for using
     *     in the 'larger than' filter, so special code needed to be implemented
     *     to work around this fact. One value is recognized at the moment:
     *     "date". (Please don't use date fields as id_field though, or only as
     *     a last resort. See the code for issues.)
     *   - id_field_not_unique (bool):
     *     This must be true if the ID field does not contain unique values.
     *   - take (int; recommended):
     *     'take' argument to getData() call, i.e. the batch size. Testing shows
     *     that the default for Rest clients is 100; for SOAP clients it must be
     *     specified (because the default is to return no records). Setting this
     *     is not required but will make for one less getData() call (because if
     *     it is not set, we're only done if a call returns 0 items).
     *   - take_total (int):
     *     The maximum total number of records to return for this data set (over
     *     one or several calls). If this is provided, then 'take' is required.
     *   - skip (string):
     *     'skip' argument to the first getData() call; ignored on further calls.
     *   - filters (array):
     *     Any (extra) filter parameter to getData().
     *   - options (array):
     *     Any 'options' argument to pass to getData(). This method only works
     *     when the return value is an array, so setting a 'Outputformat' option
     *     that results in anything else will cause an exception.
     * @param array $context
     *   An array with context data that will be modified by the call, and that
     *   should be passed unmodified to every next call to get the next batch in
     *   a data set. Two properties are important:
     *   - subtotal: should be empty for calls which fetch the first batch of a
     *     data set.
     *   - finished: should be checked after every call; true means that the
     *     full data set is returned and no more calls must be made (except to
     *     perhaps get a new data set, after unsetting 'subtotal').
     *
     * @return array
     *   A batch of records.
     *
     * @throws \InvalidArgumentException
     *   If values inside the arguments / context have an illegal value / type.
     * @throws \RuntimeException
     *   If we cannot process the records returned by getData().
